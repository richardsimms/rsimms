## Site — Pattern Lab

This source of RSimms.com. This site has been hand coded by myself based on [Pattern Lab](http://patternlab.io) to create an atomic designed static [portfolio website](http://rsimms.com). This library of elements will provide the building blocks and support the site design.

The code is hosted here on [GitHub](https://richardsimms.github.io/rsimms/public/index.html), if you have found a bug or would like to pick around with the code you can.
