	"name" : "About Richard Simms",
	"intro-1" : "Now a London designer at SapientNitro, I am originally from North Yorkshire and moved to the capital in 2004. Much of my early work focused on digital art and I admired artist like Dylan Cole.",
	"intro-2" : "After studying for a MSc Computer Animation at University of Westminster I was still leaning towards a career in film and matte paintings. I still actively enjoy taking photographs. However I got my first job working for Channel Four, where I worked as a multi-disciplined designer and this generalist role has shaped my career. I became more interested in the real-time broadcast graphics. I created animated 3D overlay, interfaces, virtual reality and Augmented reality graphics. ",
	"intro-3" : "I now work for a digital agency. Where I create design systems for platforms and prototypes experiences. I lead human-centred design projects and work in sprints. To research, design, test and iterate on ideas. I combine my experience to create with live data, long flow animated interfaces. To enhance the usability and to make branded experience simple and easy for people to engage with. With a digital mindset, I lead transformational design and help to connect technologies. Through brute force of trying and testing new ideas. To create new opportunities and better connected experiences. Find out more on my LinkedIn "
