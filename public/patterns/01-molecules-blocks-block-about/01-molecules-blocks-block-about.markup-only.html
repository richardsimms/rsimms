		<h2>About Richard Simms</h2>
		<p>Now a London designer at SapientNitro, I am originally from North Yorkshire and moved to the capital in 2004. Much of my early work focused on digital art and I admired artist like Dylan Cole. By pushing the boundaries of digital experience I hope to make my world a slightly better place.
